# picsort ðŸ“¸
Organize JPG/JPEG photos into folders by date through the command line. 


It uses [node-exif](https://github.com/gomfunkel/node-exif) to extract the created date from an image. If the exif data is not available, picsort will try to extract the created date from the filename, otherwise it will remain in the original location.

## Usage

**Tip:** You can also drag and drop folders! (see the demo)
